# Microservices with API Gateway

A complete **Spring Boot 3** and **Java 21** implementation of the **Microservices with API Gateway** hands-on exercises. This project demonstrates how multiple independent microservices communicate through **Spring Cloud Gateway** while being registered with **Eureka Discovery Server**.

---

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture divides a large application into multiple small, independently deployable services. Each service owns its own business logic and database, while **Spring Cloud Gateway** provides centralized routing and **Eureka Discovery Server** enables dynamic service discovery.

# Create Account Microservice

### Description

Developed an independent **Account Microservice** exposing REST APIs for retrieving account information. The service uses **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL**.

### Implementation

- Spring Boot REST API
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Integration
- Account Controller
- Account Repository
- Account Service Layer

### Endpoint

```text
GET http://localhost:8080/accounts/{accountNumber}
```

Example

```text
GET http://localhost:8080/accounts/00987987973432
```

### Output

```text
outputs/output1.png
```

# Create Loan Microservice

### Description

Implemented an independent **Loan Microservice** that exposes loan-related REST APIs.

### Implementation

- Spring Boot REST API
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Integration
- Loan Controller
- Loan Repository
- Loan Service Layer

### Endpoint

```text
GET http://localhost:8081/loans/{loanNumber}
```

Example

```text
GET http://localhost:8081/loans/H00987987972342
```

### Output

```text
outputs/output2.png
```

# Create Eureka Discovery Server

### Description

Configured **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Discovery Server** to act as the central registry for all microservices.

### Implementation

- Eureka Server
- Service Registry
- Spring Cloud Discovery
- Dashboard

### Endpoint

```text
http://localhost:8761
```

### Output

```text
outputs/output3.png
```

![Output 3](outputs/output3.png)

# Register Microservices with Eureka

### Description

Registered the **Account Service** and **Loan Service** with Eureka Discovery Server for automatic service discovery.

### Implementation

- Eureka Client
- Service Registration
- Heartbeat Configuration
- Dynamic Discovery

### Verification

Open Eureka Dashboard

```text
http://localhost:8761
```

Verify that

- ACCOUNT-SERVICE
- LOAN-SERVICE

are successfully registered.

### Output

```text
outputs/output4.png
```

# Create Greet Service

### Description

Developed a simple **Greeting Microservice** that exposes a REST endpoint returning a welcome message. This service is later accessed through the API Gateway.

### Implementation

- Spring Boot REST API
- Simple Greeting Controller
- Eureka Client Registration
- Service Discovery

### Endpoint

```text
GET http://localhost:8082/greet
```

### Expected Response

```text
Hello World!!
```

### Output

```text
outputs/output5.png
```

# Create API Gateway

### Description

Implemented **Spring Cloud API Gateway** to provide a single entry point for all microservices. The gateway dynamically routes client requests to the appropriate service using Eureka Discovery.

### Implementation

- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Dynamic Route Configuration
- Eureka Discovery Client
- Service Routing
- Centralized API Access

### Gateway Endpoints

#### Greet Service

```text
GET http://localhost:9091/greet-service/greet
```

#### Account Service

```text
GET http://localhost:9091/account-service/accounts/00987987973432
```

#### Loan Service

```text
GET http://localhost:9091/loan-service/loans/H00987987972342
```

### Output

```text
outputs/output6.png
```

# Configure Global Logging Filter

### Description

Added a **Global Logging Filter** in Spring Cloud Gateway to intercept every incoming request and outgoing response. This demonstrates centralized request monitoring at the gateway level.

### Implementation

- Global Gateway Filter
- Request Logging
- Response Logging
- Logging Before Routing
- Logging After Response

### Test Using Gateway

```text
GET http://localhost:9091/greet-service/greet
```

Observe the Gateway console logs for request and response details.

### Output

```text
outputs/output7.png
```
